*This* is the context of a function invocation.

*This* is the global object in a function invocation.

*This* is *undefined* in a function invocation in strict mode.

*Scope* refers to visibility of variables (in scope or not).

*Context* in JavaScript is related to objects.

* [JavaScript data types and data structures (article)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)

JavaScript is a *loosely typed* and *dynamic* language.

The latest ECMAScript standard defines **nine types**: undefined, boolean, number, string, bigInt, symbol, object, function, null.

TypeOf for Data Types and instanceof for Structural Types: 
- {} - Object
- Function - function
- Array - Object
- null - Object
- new String/Boolean/Number - Object
- undefined - undefined
- true - boolean
- "Text" - string
- alert - function
- [] - object
- new Date - object

// Inline callback function
reduce(function callbackFn(accumulator, currentValue, index, array) { ... }, initialValue)
```

* [Function declaration vs. function expression (article)](https://medium.com/@mandeep1012/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions-b43646042052)

Function declarations load before any code is executed while Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code.

Similar to the var statement, function declarations are hoisted to the top of other code. Function expressions arenâ€™t hoisted, which allows them to retain a copy of the local variables from the scope where they were defined.

* [The JS Call Stack Explained In 9 Minutes (video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8AeMrVtFLY)

What is the Call Stack? A "todo list" of function invocations (Last In, First out).

Whenever you invoke a function, the details of the invocation are saved to the top of the stack (pushed to the top).

Whenever a function returns, the info about the invocation is taken off the top of the stack (popped off of the top).
